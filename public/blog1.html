                An effective brand strategy gives you a major edge in
                increasingly competitive markets. But what exactly does
                "branding" mean? Simply put, your brand is your promise to your
                customer. It tells them what they can expect from your products
                and services, and it differentiates your offering from that of
                your competitors. Your brand is derived from who you are, who
                you want to be and who people perceive you to be
                <br /><br />
                Are you the innovative maverick in your industry? Or the
                experienced, reliable one? Is your product the high-cost,
                high-quality option, or the low-cost, high-value option? You
                can't be both, and you can't be all things to all people. Who
                you are should be based to some extent on who your target
                customers want and need you to be.
                <br /><br />
                The foundation of your brand is your logo. Your website,
                packaging and promotional materials--all of which should
                integrate your logo--communicate your brand.
                <br /><br />
                Your brand strategy is how, what, where, when and to whom you
                plan on communicating and delivering on your brand messages.
                Where you advertise is part of your brand strategy. Your
                distribution channels are also part of your brand strategy. And
                what you communicate visually and verbally is part of your brand
                strategy, too.
                <br /><br />
                Consistent, strategic branding leads to a strong brand equity,
                which means the added value brought to your company's products
                or services that allows you to charge more for your brand than
                what identical, unbranded products command. The most obvious
                example of this is Coke vs. a generic soda. Because Coca-Cola
                has built a powerful brand equity, it can charge more for its
                product--and customers will pay that higher price.
                <br /><br />
                The added value intrinsic to brand equity frequently comes in
                the form of perceived quality or emotional attachment. For
                example, Nike associates its products with star athletes, hoping
                customers will transfer their emotional attachment from the
                athlete to the product. For Nike, it's not just the shoe's
                features that sell the shoe.
                <br /><br />
                Defining your brand is like a journey of business
                self-discovery. It can be difficult, time-consuming and
                uncomfortable. It requires, at the very least, that you answer
                the questions below:
                <br /><br />
                What is your company's mission?What are the benefits and
                features of your products or services?What do your customers and
                prospects already think of your company?What qualities do you
                want them to associate with your company?
                <br /><br />
                Do your research. Learn the needs, habits and desires of your
                current and prospective customers. And don't rely on what you
                think they think. Know what they think.
                <br /><br />
                Once you've defined your brand, how do you get the word out?
                Here are a few simple, time-tested tips:
                <br />
              </p>

              <ul
                style="
                  font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
                  color: #000000;
                  font-size: 18px;
                  letter-spacing: 1px;
                  line-height: 2;
                "
              >
                <li>
                  Get a great logo. Place it everywhere. Write down your brand
                  messaging. What are the key messages you want to communicate
                  about your brand? Every employee should be aware of your brand
                  attributes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Integrate your brand. Branding extends to every aspect of your
                  business--how you answer your phones, what you or your
                  salespeople wear on sales calls, your email signature,
                  everything.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Create a "voice" for your company that reflects your brand.
                  This voice should be applied to all written communication and
                  incorporated in the visual imagery of all materials, online
                  and off. Is your brand friendly? Be conversational. Is it
                  ritzy? Be more formal. You get the gist.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Develop a tagline. Write a memorable, meaningful and concise
                  statement that captures the essence of your brand.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Design templates and create brand standards for your marketing
                  materials. Use the same color scheme, logo placement, look and
                  feel throughout. You don't need to be fancy, just consistent.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Be true to your brand. Customers won't return to you--or refer
                  you to someone else--if you don't deliver on your brand
                  promise.
                </li>
              </ul>

                Be consistent. This tip involves all the above and is the most
                important tip on this list. If you can't do this, your attempts

                  Emotions: This is the key part of creating your power brand,
                  upon which everything else will be built. If you don't have
                  emotions as an ingredient in your product/service, then you
                  don't have a brand, you just have a commodity.

                  Perception: Emotions are not stirred or influenced by thin
                  air. They are the result of sensory stimulation arriving at
                  brand through five senses *Sight *Sound *Smell *Taste *Touch
                  Most small businesses focus only on the ''sight'' sense
                  ignoring the power of the other four to really build a strong
                  perception of the brand in customer's mind.

                  up with novel ways of presenting sensory information is
                  something else. This is where your brand becomes your guiding
                  light. All the important process systems and proceduresWill be
                  documented in your brand and employees will be given guidance
                  on how to monitor and improve each customer brand reflection.
                  Innovation is what keeps the brand alive and kicking, it gives
                  longevity To an otherwise stagnant and outdated brand, and
                  provides freshness needed to keep your brand “top of mind
